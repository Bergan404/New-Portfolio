# Setting Up Directory with Ruby
- Locate the file location
- In terminal run *bundle init*
- In the Gem File add gems that you want to use with *gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.3', '>= 4.3.1'*
- Once Gems are added run *bundle install*
- Once all that is done and ready use *bundle exec jekyll serve* (The server will run on port 4000)
